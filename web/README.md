Engineering Community Platform


**Project Description**

The Engineering Community Platform helps engineering students and professionals by providing a space to ask questions and share knowledge. Users can post questions, and seniors or experienced members can respond with helpful answers and resources. It also encourages collaboration through discussions and problem-solving, making it easier to learn, grow, and connect with others in the engineering field.
Junior engineering students often feel lost when navigating academics and career decisions. The platform provides a safe space to ask questions and receive guidance from seniors who have faced similar challenges, helping juniors gain clarity and confidence in their journey.
