### What problem does your project solve?

1. **Parcel Theft**:
   - In urban areas, particularly on college campuses or apartment buildings, parcel theft has become a common issue. Once a package is delivered, it is often left unattended and becomes vulnerable to theft.
   
2. **Parcel Misplacement or Damage**:
   - Parcels are sometimes misplaced by delivery companies or left in inappropriate locations, leading to damage or loss. Additionally, inaccurate or incomplete tracking systems make it difficult for recipients to know the exact status of their packages.

3. **Lack of Secure Monitoring**:
   - There's often no dedicated monitoring system that keeps track of the parcels and ensures their safety. Users may not know where their package is or if it's been safely delivered.
   
4. **Limited Job Opportunities for Admins**:
   - The parcel management process could benefit from dedicated admin oversight to ensure smooth operation. The app creates job opportunities for individuals who can serve as admins, helping oversee deliveries and keeping track of parcel statuses.

### Why is it useful?

In urban areas, especially college campuses and apartments, theft of parcels has become a rampant issue. **Students** and **residents** often face the inconvenience of missing or damaged packages that were either stolen or misplaced during delivery. The lack of a secure, monitored delivery system has created a growing need for a service that ensures the safe tracking, storage, and delivery of parcels.

The **Parcel Monitor App** is designed to act as a **middleman** between the delivery company and the recipient, creating a more secure environment for parcel management. By using an **admin-backed monitoring system**, this app helps:
- **Prevent theft**: Through better tracking and monitoring of packages.
- **Reduce misplacement**: Ensures that parcels are safely delivered and tracked.
- **Create job opportunities**: Admins are responsible for overseeing the system, which opens up opportunities for individuals to manage parcel deliveries and assist in customer service.

This app serves as both a **solution to a growing problem** and a **means to create jobs** for those looking to assist in the parcel management process.
